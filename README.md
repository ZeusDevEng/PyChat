# 📬 PyChat Gui App
This Python application demonstrates a basic TCP socket server and client communication with a graphical user interface (GUI), allowing for real-time message exchanges over the network.
## ✨ Features
 -   🚀 Simple TCP socket server and client implementation in Python.
 -   💬 Server and client can exchange messages over the network seamlessly.
 -   🖥️ GUI application for interactive message exchange.
 -   🧵 Support for multi-threading, allowing multiple clients to connect and communicate simultaneously.
## 📋 **Prerequisites**
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
 -   🐍 Python 3.x
## 🛠 Installation
Follow these steps to get your environment ready:
**1. Create a Python virtual environment:**

    python3 -m venv EnvironmentName
**2. Activate the virtual environment:**
    On Windows:

    .\EnvironmentName\Scripts\activate

 On Unix or MacOS:

    source EnvironmentName/bin/activate

**3. Install the dependencies required:**
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
## 🚀 Getting Started

 - To run the server:
 `python server.py`
 - Then, run the client application. You can run multiple instances for
   multiple clients:
